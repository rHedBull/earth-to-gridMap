# earth-to-gridMap

The code utilizes Google Earth Engine to fetch land cover data for a specific region. It then processes this data to generate an image and a plot showcasing the distribution of different land cover types within the area. The results are finally saved to a CSV file. Let me know if you have any other questions.
